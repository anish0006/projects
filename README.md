  Project Overview
  
This project analyzes data from the T20 World Cup 2022 to find the best players in various roles (Opener, Middle Order, Finisher, and Bowler). The goal is to determine the Best XI from all the teams, based on a set of predefined criteria for each role. Using data analytics and visualization techniques, this analysis aims to give a comprehensive view of player performances during the tournament

Key Objectives:

Identify the Best Openers based on criteria such as strike rate, average, and runs scored during the powerplay.

Select the Best Middle Order batsmen using factors like consistency, strike rate in middle overs, and contribution to team totals.

Determine the Best Finisher by evaluating death-over performance, strike rate in the last few overs, and match-winning contributions.

Find the Best Bowlers based on their economy rate, wickets taken, performance in powerplay and death overs.

Build the Best XI from the entire tournament based on player contributions across roles.

Dataset

Source: The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from publicly available cricket databases and websites like ESPNcricinfo, ICC official site, and others.
